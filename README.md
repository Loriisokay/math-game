# Math Game! 

## A simple game to practice React

A player has to solve math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication): 

!['a math problem'](./public/tasks.png)

As soon as the score is 10, the game finishes: 

!['a math problem'](./public/winner.png)

The project has been done to practice the use of **React** and **Particles.js**.
